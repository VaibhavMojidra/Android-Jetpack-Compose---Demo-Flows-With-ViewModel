# Android Jetpack Compose Demo Flows With ViewModel

Kotlin Flows are particularly useful in Android development due to their ability to handle asynchronous operations and data streams efficiently. ViewModel is a part of Android Jetpack and is used to manage and store UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way1. It allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
